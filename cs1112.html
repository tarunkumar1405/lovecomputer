        <summary>Chapter 1: COMPUTER SYSTEM</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to Computer System</li>
          <p>
            A computer system is an electronic device that processes and stores
            data, performs tasks, and executes instructions to perform specific
            functions. It is made up of several components, including hardware,
            software, and peripherals.<br />

            Hardware components of a computer system include the central
            processing unit (CPU), which is responsible for processing data and
            instructions, as well as the memory, storage devices, and
            input/output devices. The memory stores data and instructions that
            are currently being used by the CPU, while storage devices such as
            hard disk drives and solid-state drives store data and programs for
            long-term use.<br />

            Software is the set of instructions and programs that control the
            hardware components of a computer system. This includes the
            operating system, which manages the computer's resources and
            provides a user interface, as well as application software that is
            used to perform specific tasks.<br />

            Peripherals are external devices that can be connected to a computer
            system to provide additional functionality. This includes devices
            such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, and cameras.<br />

            The interaction between these components is what allows a computer
            system to perform tasks and run programs. When a user inputs data or
            requests an action, the input device sends the data or command to
            the CPU, which then processes it and sends the output to the display
            or other output device.<br />

            Overall, the computer system is an essential tool in modern society,
            used for everything from communication and entertainment to
            scientific research and business operations.<br />

          <li>Introductions</li>
          <li>Digital Footprints</li>
          <p>
            Digital footprints refer to the traces or information that a person
            leaves behind when they use the internet or digital devices. These
            footprints can include things like social media posts, search
            history, emails, comments on forums or blogs, online purchases, and
            other forms of digital communication.<br />Digital footprints can
            have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, they can
            be useful for creating a positive online reputation or demonstrating
            a person's expertise in a particular area. On the other hand,
            digital footprints can also be used by others to track a person's
            online behavior, potentially leading to privacy concerns or even
            identity theft.<br />It is important to be aware of your digital
            footprint and take steps to protect your privacy and security
            online. This can include using strong passwords, avoiding
            oversharing personal information, being cautious of what you post
            online, and regularly monitoring your online accounts and activity.
          </p>
          <li>Digital Society and Netizen</li>
          <p>
            A digital society is a society that has transitioned to using
            digital technologies as the primary means of communication,
            commerce, and social interaction. The use of digital technologies
            has enabled people to connect with each other, access information,
            and conduct business more efficiently and effectively. This has
            transformed many aspects of society, including education, politics,
            healthcare, and entertainment.<br />A netizen, or "internet
            citizen," is a person who regularly engages in online activities and
            contributes to online communities. Netizens can take on various
            roles, such as content creators, social media influencers, or online
            activists. Netizens are an important part of the digital society, as
            they contribute to the creation and dissemination of digital content
            and help shape the online culture.<br />However, the digital society
            and the role of netizens also come with challenges, such as the
            spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and online harassment. It
            is important for individuals and society as a whole to promote
            responsible digital citizenship and address these challenges to
            ensure that the benefits of the digital society can be realized for
            everyone. This can include promoting digital literacy and education,
            fostering a culture of respect and inclusion online, and ensuring
            that laws and policies protect the rights and safety of individuals
            in the digital space.
          </p>
          <li>Data Protection</li>
          <p>
            Data protection refers to the measures that organizations and
            individuals take to safeguard personal and sensitive information
            from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This includes
            protecting data that is stored electronically or on paper.<br />Data
            protection is important because personal and sensitive data can be
            used for malicious purposes such as identity theft, fraud, or
            extortion. Data breaches, where large amounts of data are
            compromised, have become increasingly common in recent years and can
            result in serious harm to individuals and organizations.<br />Data
            protection can involve a range of measures, including encryption,
            secure storage, and access controls. It can also involve following
            regulations and laws related to data privacy and protection, such as
            the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union
            or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United
            States.<br />Individuals also play an important role in data
            protection by being vigilant about their personal data and using
            strong passwords, avoiding oversharing personal information online,
            and regularly monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity.
          </p>

          <li>Cyber Crime</li>
          <p>
            Cyber crime refers to criminal activities that are committed using
            the internet or other digital technologies. These crimes can take
            many forms, such as theft, fraud, harassment, extortion, or
            sabotage. Cyber criminals can target individuals, businesses,
            organizations, or governments, and they often use sophisticated
            techniques to carry out their activities.<br />Examples of cyber
            crimes include phishing attacks, malware and ransomware attacks,
            hacking, identity theft, online harassment, and financial fraud.
            These crimes can cause significant financial losses, damage
            reputations, and compromise sensitive data.<br />Preventing and
            combating cyber crime requires a multi-faceted approach that
            involves individuals, businesses, and governments. This includes
            implementing strong security measures, such as using complex
            passwords and multi-factor authentication, encrypting data, and
            regularly updating software and security systems.<br />Individuals
            should also be cautious when using the internet, such as avoiding
            suspicious emails or links, and protecting their personal
            information. Businesses and organizations should also provide cyber
            security training and education for employees, establish incident
            response plans, and conduct regular security audits.<br />Governments
            can help combat cyber crime by enacting laws and regulations related
            to data privacy and cyber security, providing resources and support
            for law enforcement agencies, and cooperating internationally to
            combat cyber crime across borders.
          </p>
          <li>Indian Information Technology Act(IT Act)</li>
          <p>
            The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) is a law in India that
            governs electronic transactions, electronic governance, and cyber
            security. The law was enacted on 17 October 2000 and was amended in
            2008.<br />The IT Act provides a legal framework for electronic
            transactions, digital signatures, and electronic records. It also
            defines cyber crimes and provides for penalties for offences such as
            hacking, identity theft, and phishing. The law also established the
            office of the Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA) to license
            and regulate the operation of certifying authorities that issue
            digital signatures.<br />The IT Act also amended other existing laws
            such as the Indian Penal Code and the Indian Evidence Act to include
            provisions related to electronic documents and digital signatures.
            The law has been further amended in subsequent years to keep pace
            with the rapid evolution of technology and emerging cyber
            threats.<br />The IT Act has been an important step in providing a
            legal framework for electronic transactions and combating cyber
            crime in India. However, there have been criticisms of the law,
            including concerns about its potential impact on freedom of speech
            and expression, and calls for further reforms to address these
            issues.
          </p>
          <li>Impact on Health</li>
          <p>
            The impact of technology on health can be both positive and
            negative. On the positive side, technology has transformed the
            healthcare industry, leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and
            management of illnesses. It has also enabled remote consultations,
            telemedicine, and access to healthcare services in remote or
            underserved areas.<br />Technology has also made it easier for
            individuals to monitor their health and fitness. Wearable devices,
            mobile apps, and other digital tools can track vital signs, physical
            activity, and diet, providing individuals with personalized feedback
            and guidance.<br />On the negative side, technology can also have
            adverse effects on health, such as causing physical strain, eye
            strain, and sleep disturbances. Prolonged use of digital devices can
            lead to conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive strain
            injury, and back pain. The blue light emitted by digital screens can
            also disrupt sleep patterns, leading to sleep disturbances and
            fatigue.<br />The excessive use of technology, such as spending
            excessive time on social media or playing video games, can also lead
            to addiction, social isolation, and mental health problems such as
            anxiety and depression.<br />To minimize the negative impact of
            technology on health, it is important to take regular breaks from
            digital devices, practice good ergonomics, and follow healthy habits
            such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep. It is
            also important for individuals to be aware of the risks associated
            with excessive use of technology and to seek professional help if
            necessary.
